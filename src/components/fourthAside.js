        If a person is {evalIt}, there are various healthful weight-gain methods
        that they can try. A person can gain weight by following a healthful
        diet that incorporates nutritious calorie-dense foods. A doctor may
        recommend a person tries a specific diet for weight gain or refer them
        to a dietitian, who can help a person develop a diet plan that works for
        them.
      </h4>
      <h5>Some key components of a diet for weight gain may include:</h5>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Adding snacks :- </b> <br />
          High-protein and whole-grain carbohydrate snacks can help a person
          gain weight. Examples include peanut butter crackers, protein bars,
          trail mix, pita chips and hummus, or a handful of almonds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eating several small meals a day :- </b> <br />
          Sometimes a person may be {evalIt} because they cannot tolerate eating
          large meals. Instead, a person can eat several small meals throughout
          the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Incorporating additional food :- </b> <br /> A person can add
          calorie-dense food sources to their existing diet, such as putting
          slivered almonds on top of cereal or yogurt, sunflower or chia seeds
          on a salad or soup, or nut butter on whole-grain toast.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding empty calories :- </b> <br />
          Eating high-calorie foods may cause a person to gain weight, but they
          also have excess fats that could affect a personâ€™s heart and blood
          vessels. A person should avoid foods that are high in sugar and salt.
