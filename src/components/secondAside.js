      <h2>Risks of being {evalIt}</h2>
      <h4>Being {evalIt} can cause health problems, just as being {evalIt} can.</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Not all people who are {evalIt} experience adverse side effects or
          symptoms from being {evalIt}. However, some people, experience the
          following symptoms related to being {evalIt}:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Osteoporosis :- </b> <br />
          According to a 2016 studyTrusted Source, being {evalIt} increases a
          woman’s risk of osteoporosis, which is where the bones are brittle and
          more prone to breaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Skin, hair, or teeth problems :- </b> <br />
          If a person does not get enough nutrients in their daily diet, they
          may display physical symptoms, such as thinning skin, hair loss, dry
          skin, or poor dental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Getting sick frequently :- </b> <br />
          If a person does not get enough energy from their diet to maintain a
          healthy body weight, they may also not be getting enough nutrients to
          fight off infections. As a result, a person may get sick more
          frequently, and common illnesses, such as a cold, can last longer than
          they usually would.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Feeling tired all the time :- </b> <br />
          Calories are a measurement of the energy a particular food can give a
          person. Not getting enough calories to maintain a healthy weight can
          make a person feel fatigued.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Anemia :- </b> <br />A person who is {evalIt} is more likely to have
          low blood counts, known as anemia, which causes dizziness, headaches,
          and fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Irregular periods :- </b> <br />
          Women who are {evalIt} may not have regular periods, they may find
          menstruation stops, or an adolescent’s first period may be delayed or
          absent. Irregular or absent menstruation can cause infertility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Premature births :- </b> <br />
          According to a study published in An International Journal of
          Obstetrics & GynaecologyTrusted Source, a woman who is pregnant and
          {evalIt} is at a higher risk for pre-term labor, which means having a
          baby before 37 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Slow or impaired growth :- </b> <br />
          Young people need nutrients to grow and develop healthy bones. Being
          {evalIt} and not getting enough calories could mean a person may not
          develop as expected. Doctors call this a ‘failure to thrive.’
